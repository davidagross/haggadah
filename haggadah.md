# A Modern Passover

*For those who want to remember, for those who want to take stock, for those who want to be thankful, and for those who want to get to the meal faster.*

> This Haggadah was compiled by [Mischa Nachtigal](http://twitter.com/mischa) and [Tina Vaughn](http://www.tinamvaughn.com/) in 2013. But we borrowed heavily from a few sources. You can read [a quick post about the process of putting it together](https://medium.com/this-matters-to-me/761efa25d839). 

> This is a condensed version from the adaptation "[A Humanist Modern Version Haggadah For Passover](http://www.eszter.com/Haggadah.pdf)" by [Eszter Hargittai](http://www.twitter.com/eszter). Her text is great, but we wanted to make it shorter and add in some of our favorite quotes. She got her version by adapting Machar's ["A HUMANIST HAGGADAH FOR PASSOVER"](http://www.machar.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Machar-Humanistic-Haggadah.pdf) and ["Passover Haggadah for a Secular-Humanist Seder"](http://www.citycongregation.org/celebrations/sample-services/#passover) City Congregation for Humanistic Judaism, New York City.

> Then I came along and read it for our Passeaster Feasting with my family in 2018.  We skipped around and switched tabs a bit, so for Passover 2019 I forked their work to make it my own.  We've pulled in some more thinking and text from various [references](references).

## Invitation

**First Reader**: We have come together this evening for many reasons. We are here because Spring is all around, the Earth is reborn, and it is a good time to celebrate with family and friends. 

**Group:** *We are here because the struggle for human freedom never stops. We are here to remember all people who are still struggling for their freedom.* 

**Next Reader**: We welcome the warmth and light of Spring. We rejoice in the warm light and rich blessings of this season. 

**Group**: *The light of these candles symbolizes a renewal of life, a reaffirmation of freedom.*

[Light candles]

**Group**: *BAH-ROOCH HA-OR BAH-OLAM, BAH-ROOCH HA-OR BAH-ADAM, AH-SHER KEE-DEH-SHAH-NOO BEH-MITZ-VOH-TAHV VEH-TZEE-VAH-NOO LEH-HAD-LEEK NER SHEL YOHM TOHV*


## Kiddush, the first cup of wine

**Next Reader**: Let us all fill our glasses with wine... Spring is the season of new growth and new life. Every living thing must either grow, or die; growth is a sign and a condition of life. 

**Next Reader**: Like no other creature, the most significant growth for a human being takes place inwardly. We grow as we achieve new insights, new knowledge, new goals. Let us raise our cups to signify our gratitude for life, and for the joy of knowing inner growth, which gives human life its meaning. And with raised cups, together let us say: 

**Group**: *Peace to everyone.* 

**Group**: *BAH-ROOCH HA-OR BAH-OLAM, BAH-ROOCH HA-OR BAH-ADAM, BOH-REY PREE HAH-GAH-FEN.*


## The Story Of Passover

**Next Reader**: Passover is the celebration of Life. Despite many centuries of memories of destruction our hearts are tempered by the knowledge that the world can also be good. We have endured slavery and humiliation. But we have also enjoyed freedom and power. 

**Group:** *We have learned to endure. We have learned to progress. We don’t just survive, we live, and we thrive.*

**Next Reader**: It is written that long ago, during a time of famine, the ancient Israelites traveled to Egypt. According to this legend, the Israelites at that time were all in a single family - Jacob and his children. 
 
**Next Reader**: One of Jacob's sons was Joseph. He was so wise that the ruler of Egypt - the Pharaoh - made Joseph a leader over all the people of Egypt. 
 
**Next Reader**: But as time passed, another Pharaoh became the ruler of Egypt. He did not remember about Joseph and his wise leadership. This new Pharaoh turned the Israelites into slaves, and burdened them with heavy work and sorrow. 
 
**Next Reader**: After the Israelites were in Egypt for over 400 years, a man arose among them. He demanded that Pharaoh let his people go! Many times he risked his life to insist on the freedom of his people, until he finally succeeded. 
 
**Next Reader**: At our Passover Seder, we celebrate the story of Moses and the people he led out of slavery 3000 years ago. We celebrate the struggle of all people to be free.  Throughout the centuries, the story of Moses and the exodus from Egypt has inspired Jews and non-Jews in times of persecution and hardship. 
 
**Group**: *Let us remember that the thirst for freedom exists in all people.* 

## The Four Questions (+1)

**Youngest Person**: MA NEESH-TA-NAH HA-LIE-LAH HA-ZEH MEE-KOHL HA-LAY LOHT — Why is this night different from all other nights? 

1. SHE-B'-KHOL HA-LAY-LOHT A-NOO O-KH'-LEEN KHA-MAYTZ OO-MA- TSA. HA-LIE-LA HA-ZEH KOO-LOH MA-TSA. — On all other nights we eat either bread or matsah. Why, on this night, do we eat only matsah? 

2. SHE-B'-KHOL HA-LAY-LOHT A-NOO O-KH'-LEEN SH'-AR YIH'- RAH- KOHT. HA-LIE-LA HA-ZEH MA-ROR. — On all other nights we eat herbs of any kind. Why, on this night, do we eat only bitter herbs? 

3. SHE-B'KHOL HA-LAY-LOHT AYN A-NOO MAT-BEE-LEEN AFEE-LOO PA-AM EH-KHAT. HA-LIE-LA HA-ZEH SH'TAY F'-AHMEEM. — On all other nights, we do not dip our herbs even once. Why, on this night, do we dip them twice? 

4. SHE-B'KHOL HA-LAY-LOHT A-NOO O-KH'-LEEN BAYN YOSH'-VEEN OO-VAYN M'-SOO-BEEN. HA-LIE-LA HA-ZEH KOOLA-NOO M'-SOO-BEEN. — On all other nights, we eat either sitting or leaning. Why, on this night, do we eat while leaning? 

5. The “plus one” question: The original Passover did not include an orange on the Seder plate. Why, on this night, do we have an orange on the Seder plate? 


## Passover and Freedom

**Next Reader**: At our Passover Seder, we celebrate the story of Moses and the people he led out of slavery 3000 years ago. We remember the struggle of all people to be free. 

**Group**: *Let us remember that the thirst for freedom exists in all people. Many centuries after the time of Moses, African people were brought to America as slaves.*

*The freedom we celebrate tonight is not only freedom from slavery. It is also the freedom to live in peace, with dignity and with hope for a bright future.* 

**Next Reader**: We are here tonight celebrating this festival of freedom in a free land. 

**Next Reader**: This evening, as we celebrate this [our own] freedom let us take notice of the struggles toward freedom in many other parts of the world. 

**Next Reader**: “When I despair, I remember that all through history the ways of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants, and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end they always fall. Think of it--always.” — Gandhi

## Spilling The Wine

**Next Reader**: Let us all fill our cups with wine... Tonight we drink four cups of the fruit of the vine. There are many explanations for this custom. They represent, some have said, the four corners of the earth, for freedom must live everywhere; the four seasons of the year, for freedom's cycle must last through all the seasons; 

**Next Reader**: Let us diminish the wine in our cups as we recall the ten plagues that befell the Egyptian people. 

[As each plague is named, everyone dips a finger in wine and then touches a plate to remove the drop.]

**Group**: *Blood, Frogs, Gnats, Flies, Cattle Disease, Boils, Hail, Locusts, Darkness, Death of the Firstborn.* 

**Next Reader**: In the same spirit, our celebration today is also shadowed by our awareness of continuing sorrow and oppression in all parts of the world. Ancient plagues are mirrored in modern tragedies. 

**Next Reader**: We are a world people, living in many lands and among many nations. The power of science has shrunk our planet and has made all of us the children of one human family. We are all victims together of enormous social problems. We share in their effects and in the responsibility to overcome them. 

**Next Reader**: We spill wine from our cups at the mention of each of these contemporary plagues. We cannot allow ourselves to drink a full measure since our own lives are sobered by these ills, which darken our lives and diminish our joy. As the pain of others diminishes our joys, let us once more diminish the wine of our festival as we repeat the names of these modern plagues: 

**Group**: *Hunger, War, Crime, Disease, Racism, Abuse, Poverty, Homophobia, Pollution, Indifference to human suffering.* 

**Next Reader**: May there be peace, kindness, happiness, and compassion. 

## The second cup of wine

**Next Reader**: The second cup of wine is dedicated not only to the struggles of the Jewish people, but to all people seeking a secure life free of fear and persecution. In particular, may the Israelis and the Palestinians come to enjoy freedom and peace. For, as the prophet Isaiah said: 

**Group**: *They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again know war. But they shall sit every one under their vines and fig trees, and none shall make them afraid.* 

**Next Reader**: Let us all hold up our glasses of wine. 

“Nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral questions of our time: the need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to oppression and violence. Man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.” — Martin Luther King Jr, Nobel Prize Speech 1964.

**Group**: *We are awed by all life in the world. How beautiful is the life of humankind.* 

**Next Reader**: Now let us all drink our second cup of wine. 

[Drink second cup of wine]

## Answering The 4 Questions

**Next Reader**: And now it is time to answer those four questions about what makes this night different from all other nights. 

**Next Reader**: MATSAH--Why do we eat matsah? 

**Group**: *Matsah is the symbol of our affliction and our freedom.*

**Next Reader**: Legend has it that when Moses and his followers fled Egypt, they moved so quickly that the bread they baked did not have time to rise. 

**Next Reader**: However, scholars have noted that long before the Jews celebrated Passover, farmers of the Middle East celebrated KhagHa-matsot, the festival of unleavened bread, at this time of year. 

This was a festival where unleavened bread was made from the new grain harvest that took place at this time of the year. 

**Next Reader**: The old fermented dough was thrown out so that last year's grain would not be mixed with this year's. Therefore, the new season began with the eating of unleavened bread--matsah. Later on, the Jewish people incorporated this agricultural festival into the celebration of freedom and renewal we now call Passover. 

**Next Reader**: Let us all now eat a piece of matsah. 

**Next Reader**: Maror--Why do we eat maror, the bitter herb? 

**Group**: *Tradition says that this root is to remind us of the time of our slavery. We force ourselves to taste pain so that we may more readily value pleasure.* 

**Next Reader**: Scholars inform us that bitter herbs were eaten at the Spring festival in ancient times. The sharpness of the taste awakened the senses and made the people feel at one with nature's revival. Thus, maror is the stimulus of life, reminding us that struggle is better than the complacent acceptance of injustice. 

Let us all now take bitter herb and eat it. 

**Next Reader**: Salt Water--Why do we dip our food in salt water two times on this night? 

**Group**: *The first time, the salty taste reminds us of the tears we cried when we were slaves. The second time, the salt water and the green help us to remember the ocean and green plants and the Earth, from which we get air and water and food that enable us to live.*

[All dip parsley into salt water two times and eat it]

**Next Reader**: Leaning--Why do we eat while leaning on this night? 

**Next Reader**: This question goes back to ancient times in Rome, when it was the custom for rich people to eat while lying on a couch leaning on one elbow as slaves and servants fed them. The Jewish people thought of this relaxed type of eating as a sign of freedom and prosperity, so they would lean to one side eating at the Seder on Passover, the festival of freedom. Today, we who are free eat while sitting up, even at Passover, but the question remains in the service as a reminder of how it was when our people longed for freedom.

**Next Reader**: We have answered the four traditional questions, but there are still more questions to be answered. There are other special foods on our Seder plate: a sweet condiment (kharoset), a roast lamb's bone (z'ro-ah), and an egg (baytsa). Why are they here? 

Kharoset--Why do we eat kharoset? 

**Next Reader**: Apples, nuts, cinnamon, and wine are combined to make this sweet condiment. It is the color of clay or mortar. It reminds us of the bricks and mortar that the Israelites are said to have made when they built the Pharaohs' palaces and cities. At the same time, the taste of kharoset is sweet, and it reminds us of the sweetness of freedom. 

**Next Reader**: Let us now all eat kharoset on a piece of matsah. 

**Next Reader**: There is an interesting tradition to take a piece of matsah and place upon it some bitter herb (maror) and some kharoset. As you eat this, the full meaning of Passover is felt through this combination. 

**Next Reader**: Z'roa means shankbone or thigh bone. This lamb's bone takes us back, once again, to ancient times to the shepherd's festival of Pesakh. It was celebrated at the time of the full moon in the month the lambs and goats were born. At that time, each family would slaughter a young lamb or goat for a Spring feast.

**Next Reader**: Batysah--Why do we eat egg?

**Next Reader**: Baytsah is the egg of life. Each of us begins as an egg and grows to adulthood. The egg reminds us of our evolutionary past and the gifts of human inheritance. But the egg is fragile. It represents potential that can be destroyed. Left alone, its life would perish. 

**Next Reader**: Growing life needs warmth and love and security, guidance, hope, and vision. To achieve their full potential, human beings need the support and encouragement of family and community. Eggs symbolize the fragility and interdependence of life. 

**Next Reader**: Orange – why is there an orange on the Seder plate when that was not part of any traditional Passover celebrations? 

**Next Reader**: The orange on the Seder plate is the result of an experience Professor Susannah Heschel had in the early 1980s. In her own words: 

“In the early 1980s, the Hillel Foundation invited me to speak on a panel at Oberlin College. While on campus, I came across a Haggada that had been written by some Oberlin students to express feminist concerns. One ritual they devised was placing a crust of bread on the Seder plate, as a sign of solidarity with Jewish lesbians ("there's as much room for a lesbian in Judaism as there is for a crust of break on the Seder plate"). 

At the next Passover, I placed an orange on our family's Seder plate. During the first part of the Seder, I asked everyone to take a segment of the orange, make the blessing over fruit, and eat it as a gesture of solidarity with Jewish lesbians and gay men, and others who are marginalized within the Jewish community (I mentioned widows in particular).

When lecturing, I often mentioned my custom as one of many new feminist rituals that had been developed in the last twenty years. Somehow, though, the typical patriarchal maneuver occurred: 

My idea of an orange and my intention of affirming lesbians and gay men were transformed. Now the story circulates that a MAN stood up after a lecture I delivered and said to me, in anger, that a woman belongs on the bimah as much as an orange on the Seder plate. My idea, a woman's words, are attributed to a man, and the affirmation of lesbians and gay men is simply erased. Isn't that precisely what's happened over the centuries to women's ideas?”

## Breaking the Matsah

**Next Reader**: We have drunk the wine and tasted the special foods of the Passover celebration. They symbolize our attachment to the traditions of our culture, to freedom, and to life itself. Before we enjoy our feast, let us set aside the first of these symbols, the Matsah, to be the final food of this Passover supper, reminding us of why we are gathered here and what it is we celebrate. 

[Set some matsah aside, eat it last after desert]

## The third cup of wine

**Next Reader**: Let us all now fill our glasses with wine. During this festival of life, it is important for us to remember our lost sisters and brothers--the millions who died, alone and friendless, victims of genocide. Their anguish and death must be with us, even in our times of celebration. 

**Group**: *We resolve that their memory shall not be lost. We accept the responsibility of working to prevent such suffering from ever again occurring on this earth.* 

**Next Reader**: We drink the third cup of wine to those who were taken from us and to those who fought for freedom and life. 
[Drink third cup of wine]

**Next Reader**: Just as the food of our Passover supper has nourished our bodies, so the experience of the human spirit gives meaning to our lives. As a full expression of the hope and joy of this combination, let us sing the Passover song DIE-YAY-NOO. 

**Group sings:**

*Eeem yash la-noo hay-roo-tay-noo. DIE-YAY-NOO.* 

*Eeem yash la-noo sim'khah-tay-noo. DIE-YAY-NOO.* 

*Eeem yash la-noo tik'va-tay-noo. DIE-YAY-NOO.* 

Translation:

If we only had our freedom. DIE-YAY-NOO.

If we only had our Seder. DIE-YAY-NOO. 

If we only had our hope. DIE-YAY-NOO. 

["DIE-YAY-NOO" means: It would have been sufficient.] 

## The fourth cup of [Miriam & Elijah](https://citycongregation.org/liberated-hagaddah-shop/)

Our journey is nearing an end, and we gaze with longing to a day when all people will be free.

**Group**: *The name Elijah has been the symbol of hope for that future redemption.*

A leader and prophet, a lone visionary in the wilderness, Elijah led a people’s rebellion against a wicked government.

**Group**: *According to legend, Elijah never died and will return some day to announce freedom for all the people of the world.*

Throughout the history of our people the name Miriam has been the symbol of protection and healing.

**Group**: *A leader and a prophet, Miriam lived in that same wilderness and accompanied the Hebrew people at every stage of their journey.*

According to legend, wherever Miriam went, a wellspring of water sprung up that sustained the people.

**Group**: *The cup of Elijah, filled with wine, is a cup of hope.*

It stands for the vision that lies ahead.

**Group**: *The cup of Miriam, filled with water, is the cup of life.*

It offers the sustenance to take us on that journey.

**Group**: *Miriam, with her wellspring of water, is always at our side.*

We now open the door of our house and our hearts and invite Elijah to enter.

[Open a door in your house, and leave it open while you eat]

We will now raise our glasses of wine and say:

**Group:**
*We shall make peace in the world* 

*We shall make peace for ourselves* 

*And peace for all the world.*

[Drink 4th Glass Of Wine]

Water is an essential component of everything on our seder table.  Without water, there would be no food. There would be no people, no us. Similarly, without Miriam, there would be no Moses, and there would be no free Jews. There would be no us.

We will now raise our glasses of water and say:

**Group**: *Mni Wičoni.  In Standing Rock, and along every pipeline, water is under threat.  Grassy Narrows and Wabaseemoong First Nations, the water is still not safe.  This water is life, and for that we are grateful.  L'chaim.*

[Drink Glass Of Water]

## Let's Eat

**Last Reader**: Now it is time for our leisurely, and scrumptious Pesakh meal.
