Passover
========

### What is this?
A non-theistic haggadah. No "God," no denominations. Instead we have the good stories, important quotes about civil liberties, and the four questions (plus one). Only takes 15 minutes to get through. Get to your meal before the matzoh balls get cold. 

### Who did this?


### Why'd you do it?


### What are your sources?

Thanks for asking. We condensed primarily from the adaptation "A Humanist Modern Version Haggadah For Passover" by Eszter Hargittai who you can [follow on twitter @eszter](http://www.twitter.com/eszter). Her version is great, but we wanted to make it shorter and accesible to folks of all religions, not just Jews.
