A Modern Passover
========

### What is this?
A nontheistic haggadah. No "God," no denominations. Instead we have the good stories, important quotes about civil liberties, and the four questions (plus one). Only takes 15 minutes to get through. Get to your meal before the matzoh balls get cold. 

### Who did this?

Myself and my amazing girlfriend, [Tina Vaughn](http://tinamvaughn.com) put this together last year.

### Why'd you do it?

Basically: we wanted a concise nontheistic version of a Haggadah. We both love Passover: the stories, the questions, the food, the time you spend with your families, and the fact that it's a meal that has a lot of important themes that still resonate today. Slavery is still an issue in this world, and we wanted a Haggadah that focused on the theme of civil and social liberties and brought them into a modern context.

### What are your sources?

Thanks for asking. We condensed primarily from the adaptation "A Humanist Modern Version Haggadah For Passover" by [Eszter Hargittai](http://www.twitter.com/eszter). Her text is great, but we wanted to make it shorter and accesible to folks of all religions while still retaining the story of the Jewish people.
