Passover Things (A Passover Song)
=================================
[Sung to the tune of "These are a few of my favorite things"]

Cleaning and cooking and so many dishes\
Out with the hametz, no pasta, no knishes\
Fish that's gefillted, horseradish that stings\
These are a few of our Passover things.

Matzoh and karpas and chopped up haroset\
Shankbones and Kiddish and Yiddish neuroses\
Tante who kvetches and uncle who sings\
These are a few of our Passover things.

Motzi and maror and trouble with Pharoahs\
Famines and locusts and slaves with wheelbarrows\
Matzoh balls floating and eggshell that cling\
These are a few of our Passover things.\

When the plagues strike\
When the lice bite\
When we're feeling sad\
We simply remember our Passover things\
And then we don't feel so bad.
