Take Me Out To The Seder
========================
(To the tune of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame!")

Take me out to the Seder\
Take me out with the crowd.\
Feed me on matzah and chicken legs,\
I don't care for the hard-boiled eggs.\
And its root, root, root for Elijah\
That he will soon reappear.\
And let's hope, hope, hope that we'll meet\
Once again next year!

Take me out to the Seder\
Take me out with the crowd.\
Read the Haggadah\
And don't skip a word.\
Please hold your talking,\
We want to be heard.\
And lets, root, root, root for the leader\
That he will finish his spiel\
So we can nosh, nosh, nosh and by-gosh\
Let's eat the meal!!!
